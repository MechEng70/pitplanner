# Handoff (2026-11-11, second session)

Read SPEC.md and CLAUDE.md first. This note is what a fresh session needs on top of them.

## Done

- **Scaffold:** Vite + Preact + TS in `src/`, Capacitor 8 Android in `android/`, app ID
  `io.github.mecheng70.pitplanner` (permanent). Launcher icon and splash generated from `assets/`.
- **UI kit** `src/ui/` (components.tsx, ui.css, icons, ripple, back button). Screens use only the kit;
  no per-screen CSS. Roboto bundled. Pinned footers float over the scroll area with a fade and
  matching bottom padding; `KeepVisible` keeps a block on screen after changes.
- **Plan tab** (mockups 04-08) complete. Fidelity audit and screenshots: `docs/fidelity-audit.md`, `docs/fidelity/`.
- **Engine** (36 tests, `npm test`): 5-minute rounding of starts, settable temps, `onHeatSpan`,
  alarms from plan events (`engine/alarms.ts`: grouping, stable step keys, done/reminders/quiet),
  live helpers (`markPullDone`, `extendCook`, `postponeStep`, `smokerOverlaps`).
- **Alarm plugin** (Kotlin, `android/app/src/main/java/.../alarms/`), JS bridge `src/platform/alarms.ts`.
  All device tests passed, including Doze and a locked reboot: `docs/alarm-testing.md`.
  Hidden test screen: Gear, tap the version 5 times.
- **Start cook** checks alert permissions (sheet with Allow rows), saves the cook, schedules alarms.
- **Device tools** `tools/device/` (see its README): `npm run device` does a full unattended pass.

## Cook tab (mockups 12-15): done

Built and device-tested (see git log for the build). Live test with real notifications on 2026-11-11:
alert Done / +15 drain, the "N min past the step." repeat, Quiet, Pit out / Back up to temp, Start over,
Save to history, pellets link all pass. `tools/device/live.mjs` drives a short live cook (start / state /
click / restore; backs up real data first).

Fixed from that test:
- Changes made without asking (alert Done / +15, Not yet) keep serve only if every food keeps its
  minimum rest (`holdsCover` in engine/live.ts, `keepServeIfCovered` in cook.ts); otherwise serve moves.
- Keep/Move sheet: "X: off heat N min after serve." when keep would leave a food late; preselects Move.
- Step alerts no longer auto-cancel when tapped (the body only opens the app); they stay in the shade
  until Done / +15 / swipe. A re-timed step's repeats stop but its notification stays.
- +15 on a fixed step (fire, refill) reminds from now, and not at all if its own alarm is later.
- Alert notices append instead of replacing each other.

Open: times after an early Done are not rounded (Check at 6:41 PM). Banner "OK" sometimes reads as
not stable to Playwright (only matters for scripts).

## Setup (mockups 01-03, plus Add a cooker 17): done

`src/screens/setup/Setup.tsx` (3 steps: Welcome + units, cookers, alerts), `SmokerPicker.tsx` (picker
and the manual form, also used for unverified catalog models), `src/screens/shared/AddCooker.tsx`
(reuse in Gear). Shows when no `gear` is saved (`state.firstRun`); `finishSetup` saves gear + units.
`seedGear` is gone. Picker groups, chips and notes come from `smokerTypes` in data/cookers.json.
Kit: SetupPage, SetupActions, InputField, CheckRow, OptionCard, DashedButton, PickRow, GroupLabel
`note`, Chips `scroll`, oven avatar glyph. `npm run device` runs `tools/device/setup.mjs` -> `out/setup.png`,
`out/setup-b.png`; it wakes the screen and stops if the phone is locked (unlock it first).

Next: Gear and history (16-20; Add cooker sheet exists), Open shared plan (11) + `.pitplan` intent
filter, update check (GitHub Releases, MechEng70/pitplanner), signing.

## Decisions from Jason

- Follow the Android system font size. Times, temps, weights and countdowns never truncate at any
  scale; only secondary text may. Test at 115% and 130% (normal is 115%).
- Engine rounds phase starts to 5-minute steps; off-heat stays exact (serve - slice - rest).
- Plan: only Start cook is pinned; at 115% three cards + Add food fit, at 130% two cards.
- Food details: result card scrolls into view after any change. Known tradeoff, raised with Jason
  and not yet answered: the stepper being tapped scrolls away; alternative is pinning the result card.
- Setup step 1 is Welcome + units (the canvas has no step 1). Add a cooker (17) built with Setup.
- Alerts stay in the notification shade until handled or swiped; nothing removes them silently.
- Cost: keep sessions short, screenshot only at checkpoints, use `npm run device` instead of step-by-step driving.

## Known open items

- Pellets can exceed the hopper with no Plan warning; refill label says "under 25%" but triggers at 10% (engine).
- Step labels in `data/foods.json` contain F temperatures that do not convert in Celsius mode.
- Quiet alerts holds scheduled steps but native repeats of an already-overdue step still ring.
- Gear tab is a stand-in (Setup exists; Gear 16-20 next).
